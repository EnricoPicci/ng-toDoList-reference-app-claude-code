In the TodoDetailComponent class there is this method:
```
  deleteTodo(): void {
    this.todo$.subscribe(todo => {
      if (todo && !this.isNewTodo) {
        this.todoService.deleteTodo(todo.id);
        this.goBack();
      }
    }).unsubscribe();
  }
  ```

In this method the todo$ Observable is subscribed to get the current selected to-do and delete it.
The service must provide a method "deleteSelectedTodo" which deletes the selected to-do.
In general, the service must know which is the selected to-do at any moment, if there is one selected to-do.
Therefore remove all subscriptions to the todo$ Observable that are not in the `ngOnInit()` method.
The view Components must subscribe only in their `ngOnInit()` methods and unsubscribe in their `ngOnDestroy()` methods.

Change the Components to obey to these guidelines.
