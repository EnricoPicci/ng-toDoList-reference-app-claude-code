Build a simple Angular application to manage a “to-do” list.
A “to-do” has the following properties:
- Title
- Description
- Creation date
- Status (Status can be “open” or “done” or “deleted”)

The application must allow users to:
- Create a new “to-do”
- Change the “Description” and “Title” property of a “to-do” 
- Delete a “to-do” (if a “to-do” is deleted its status is set to “deleted”)

The app is an Angular app using the most recent version of Angular and all the best practices of a modern Angular app.
In particular follow these guidelines:
- The app is a single page app which uses the Angular router to change views
- There is a view that shows the list of all the “to-do”s which are not deleted. Each item in the list shows the Title, the Creation date and the status of the “to-do”
- There is a view that shows the details of a “to-do”
- The app starts showing the list of the “to-do”s
- If the user clicks on the Title of an item in the list, then the router routes to the Details view which shows all the details of the selected “to-do”

All state information is held in an Angular “Service” instance which is injected via Angular Dependency Injection mechanism.
The “Service” class exposes methods that trigger actions like “add”, “update” and “delete” a “to-do”
The “Service” class exposes Observable streams that notify all changes in the state.
The views subscribe to the Observable streams which are relevant for them and use the notifications to update the view.
The view Components do not hold any state.

The list of the “to-do”s is held in the “Service” class as part of the state.
There is no Database or permanent storage involved in the app.
