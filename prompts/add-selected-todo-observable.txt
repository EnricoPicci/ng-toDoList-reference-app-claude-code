In the current version of the app, the click on an item in the list shown in the TodoListComponent causes the router to navigate to the TodoDetailComponent using the method
```
  onTodoClick(todo: Todo): void {
    this.router.navigate(['/todo', todo.id]);
  }
  ```

  Change this implementation to make the navigation to the  TodoDetailComponent view reactive.
  This means that:
  - when the user clicks on an item in the list, the service notifies an event with the new "selected item" as data
  - the router routes to the TodoDetailComponent view without passing any data
  - the TodoDetailComponent view subscribes to the Observable stream that notifies the current selected item, gets the data notified and shows the selected to-do
